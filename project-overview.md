# Project Overview

Project Name: GenStack "Easy Mode" Meta-App Launcher

Description: A single-page web application acting as a portal to simplified versions of complex or futuristic tasks. It provides "easy mode" interfaces for various simulated experiences, all accessible from a central dashboard. Note that most features are mocked.

Core "Easy Mode" Modules (Mocked):

*   Crypto Launchpad "Lite": A simplified interface for *simulating* smart contract deployment on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. Users can quickly set a token name, symbol, and supply.
*   PDF Chat "Digest": An interface for uploading a single PDF (up to 100 pages) and interacting with a simulated AI chatbot. Flashcard generation and summary features are also mocked.
*   "Mars Deploy" Website Visualizer: A fun visualization of deploying a website to Mars (completely fictional, of course!). Users can enter a website URL and see a mock "launch" sequence.
*   "Pizza Time" Quick Order: A streamlined pizza ordering experience with a limited set of options.
*   Virtual Pet "Pocket Pal": A single, default virtual pet (e.g., a cute Shiba Inu) that requires basic care (feeding, playing).

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the entire meta-app.
